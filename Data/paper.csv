"Effectiveness of computer-based stress inoculation training (SIT) counseling approach on anxiety, depression, and stress of students with premenstrual syndrome","Background: Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a common public health issue affecting many women of reproductive age worldwide. This study has been designed to investigate of computer-based stress inoculation training (SIT) counseling approach on anxiety, depression, and stress of university students with PMS. Methods: A randomized trial study with two parallel arms was done from 30 October 2022 to 21 June 2023 on 100 university students aged 18 to 38 at Babol University of Medical Sciences. The participants were randomly divided into two groups intervention and control. The data collection tools included questionnaires on demographic-fertility characteristics, the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and Riff’s Psychological Well-being Scale (RPWS). The data were assessed using chi-square, t-student, ANOVA repeated measure, and linear regression tests. A significance level of P < 0.05 was considered for the analysis. Results: The results of the study showed that the SIT interventions decreased the PMS severity and most psychological factors so in the intervention group, SIT was able to significantly reduce anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and Sheehan’s disability after intervention (P < 0.001). Based on multiple linear regression analysis, the most predictors of HADS were the PSS and SDS (β = 0.285, p = 0.009 and β = 0.236, p = 0.024, respectively). Conclusion: The computer-based SIT counseling approach could reduce the severity of symptoms and psychological factors in students. Therefore, SIT intervention is recommended to manage their PMS.

The development of computational methods for Feynman diagrams,"Over the last 70 years, Feynman diagrams have played an essential role in the development of many theoretical predictions derived from the standard model Lagrangian. In fact, today they have become an essential and seemingly irreplaceable tool in quantum field theory calculations. In this article, we propose to explore the development of computational methods for Feynman diagrams with a special focus on their automation, drawing insights from both theoretical physics and the history of science. From the latter perspective, the article particularly investigates the emergence of computer algebraic programs, such as the pioneering SCHOONSCHIP, REDUCE, and ASHMEDAI, designed to handle the intricate calculations associated with Feynman diagrams. This sheds light on the many challenges faced by physicists when working at higher orders in perturbation theory and reveal, as exemplified by the test of the validity of quantum electrodynamics at the turn of the 1960s and 1970s, the indispensable necessity of computer-assisted procedures. In the second part of the article, a comprehensive overview of the current state of the algorithmic evaluation of Feynman diagrams is presented from a theoretical point of view. It emphasizes the key algorithmic concepts employed in modern perturbative quantum field theory computations and discusses the achievements, ongoing challenges, and potential limitations encountered in the application of the Feynman diagrammatic method. Accordingly, we attribute the enduring significance of Feynman diagrams in contemporary physics to two main factors: the highly algorithmic framework developed by physicists to tackle these diagrams and the successful advancement of algebraic programs used to process the involved calculations associated with them. © The Author(s) 2024.",-,10.1140/epjh/s13129-024-00067-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186547440&doi=10.1140%2fepjh%2fs13129-024-00067-6&partnerID=40&md5=cb1469f417095d535843f23b39b53573

Adhesion of Candida Albicans to digital versus conventional acrylic resins: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: The present systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the available evidence about the adherence of Candida Albicans to the digitally-fabricated acrylic resins (both milled and 3D-printed) compared to the conventional heat-polymerized acrylic resins. Methods: This study followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). A comprehensive search of online databases/search tools (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Ovid, and Google Scholar) was conducted for all relevant studies published up until May 29, 2023. Only in-vitro studies comparing the adherence of Candida albicans to the digital and conventional acrylic resins were included. The quantitative analyses were performed using RevMan v5.3 software. Results: Fourteen studies were included, 11 of which were meta-analyzed based on Colony Forming Unit (CFU) and Optical Density (OD) outcome measures. The pooled data revealed significantly lower candida colonization on the milled digitally-fabricated compared to the heat-polymerized conventionally-fabricated acrylic resin materials (MD = − 0.36; 95%CI = − 0.69, − 0.03; P = 0.03 and MD = − 0.04; 95%CI = − 0.06, − 0.01; P = 0.0008; as measured by CFU and OD respectively). However, no differences were found in the adhesion of Candida albicans between the 3D-printed digitally-fabricated compared to the heat-polymerized conventionally-fabricated acrylic resin materials (CFU: P = 0.11, and OD: P = 0.20). Conclusion: The available evidence suggests that candida is less likely to adhere to the milled digitally-fabricated acrylic resins compared to the conventional ones. © The Author(s) 2024.",-,10.1186/s12903-024-04083-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186624355&doi=10.1186%2fs12903-024-04083-2&partnerID=40&md5=5a260973c53919400b8ba2635cee9433
Investigating the overlap of machine learning algorithms in the final results of RNA-seq analysis on gene expression estimation,"Advances in computer science in combination with the next-generation sequencing have introduced a new era in biology, enabling advanced state-of-the-art analysis of complex biological data. Bioinformatics is evolving as a union field between computer Science and biology, enabling the representation, storage, management, analysis and exploration of many types of data with a plethora of machine learning algorithms and computing tools. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to detect differentially expressed genes between different types of cancer and showing the existence overlap to final results from RNA-sequencing analysis. The datasets were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information resource. Specifically, dataset GSE68086 which corresponds to PMID:200,068,086. This dataset consists of 171 blood platelet samples collected from patients with six different tumors and healthy individuals. All steps for RNA-sequencing analysis (preprocessing, read alignment, transcriptome reconstruction, expression quantification and differential expression analysis) were followed. Machine Learning- based Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms were applied to predict significant genes. The Rstudio statistical tool was used for the analysis. © The Author(s) 2024.",-,10.1007/s13755-023-00265-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186447600&doi=10.1007%2fs13755-023-00265-4&partnerID=40&md5=4ef9340f34e253f39c2bb98533651284
Applying Q-methodology to investigate computer science teachers’ preferences about students’ skills and knowledge for obtaining a degree,"Students’ dropout of Computer Science (CS) education is a crucial issue. This study aims to investigate one of the aspects which can help to retain our students. It is vital to examine CS education on the challenge of competence transition within the BSc curriculum from faculty perspectives. Teachers’ expectations about students’ skills and knowledge are important to understand because they influence learning outcomes and teaching methodologies. Acquiring hard skills and professional skills has outstanding significance in preparing students for their future careers. This study uses Q-methodology to identify the different viewpoints on the skills necessary to obtain a CS degree. Teachers from CS bachelor’s programmes at a large European university participated in the study and shared their opinions. The participants were asked to rank the statements along a spectrum of “the most important skill” to “unimportant skill” (containing hard skills as well as soft skills). Factor analysis revealed five factors that are key components to obtaining a degree in CS: 1. analytical and technical skills, 2. teamwork and self-study experience, 3. group programming experience, 4. communication and problem-solving skills, 5. mathematical foundations and process modelling ability. This exploratory study applied a new research instrument and approach to incorporate teachers’ perspectives into research and practice. These findings could help administrators develop new curricula in order to increase students’ retention. We confirmed the need for acquiring professional skills and highlighted the need for designing new programmes which can improve students’ soft skills to prepare them for work in the IT field. © The Author(s) 2024.",-,10.1057/s41599-024-02794-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186185302&doi=10.1057%2fs41599-024-02794-z&partnerID=40&md5=07f35f50b00446a86cee5ead85bb45d2
GADNN: a revolutionary hybrid deep learning neural network for age and sex determination utilizing cone beam computed tomography images of maxillary and frontal sinuses,"Introduction: The determination of identity factors such as age and sex has gained significance in both criminal and civil cases. Paranasal sinuses like frontal and maxillary sinuses, are resistant to trauma and can aid profiling. We developed a deep learning (DL) model optimized by an evolutionary algorithm (genetic algorithm/GA) to determine sex and age using paranasal sinus parameters based on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods: Two hundred and forty CBCT images (including 129 females and 111 males, aged 18–52) were included in this study. CBCT images were captured using the Newtom3G device with specific exposure parameters. These images were then analyzed in ITK-SNAP 3.6.0 beta software to extract four paranasal sinus parameters: height, width, length, and volume for both the frontal and maxillary sinuses. A hybrid model, Genetic Algorithm-Deep Neural Network (GADNN), was proposed for feature selection and classification. Traditional statistical methods and machine learning models, including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), and deep learning (DL) were evaluated for their performance. The synthetic minority oversampling technique was used to deal with the unbalanced data. Results: GADNN showed superior accuracy in both sex determination (accuracy of 86%) and age determination (accuracy of 68%), outperforming other models. Also, DL and RF were the second and third superior methods in sex determination (accuracy of 78% and 71% respectively) and age determination (accuracy of 92% and 57%). Conclusions: The study introduces a novel approach combining DL and GA to enhance sex determination and age determination accuracy. The potential of DL in forensic dentistry is highlighted, demonstrating its efficiency in improving accuracy for sex determination and age determination. The study contributes to the burgeoning field of DL in dentistry and forensic sciences. © The Author(s) 2024.",-,10.1186/s12874-024-02183-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186215075&doi=10.1186%2fs12874-024-02183-9&partnerID=40&md5=9abe8223c79a4ff60c482f537a683bbf
Semantic representation and comparative analysis of physical activity sensor observations using MOX2-5 sensor in real and synthetic datasets: a proof-of-concept-study,"The widespread use of devices like mobile phones and wearables allows for automatic monitoring of human daily activities, generating vast datasets that offer insights into long-term human behavior. A structured and controlled data collection process is essential to unlock the full potential of this information. While wearable sensors for physical activity monitoring have gained significant traction in healthcare, sports science, and fitness applications, securing diverse and comprehensive datasets for research and algorithm development poses a notable challenge. In this proof-of-concept study, we underscore the significance of semantic representation in enhancing data interoperability and facilitating advanced analytics for physical activity sensor observations. Our approach focuses on enhancing the usability of physical activity datasets by employing a medical-grade (CE certified) sensor to generate synthetic datasets. Additionally, we provide insights into ethical considerations related to synthetic datasets. The study conducts a comparative analysis between real and synthetic activity datasets, assessing their effectiveness in mitigating model bias and promoting fairness in predictive analysis. We have created an ontology for semantically representing observations from physical activity sensors and conducted predictive analysis on data collected using MOX2-5 activity sensors. Until now, there has been a lack of publicly available datasets for physical activity collected with MOX2-5 activity monitoring medical grade (CE certified) device. The MOX2-5 captures and transmits high-resolution data, including activity intensity, weight-bearing, sedentary, standing, low, moderate, and vigorous physical activity, as well as steps per minute. Our dataset consists of physical activity data collected from 16 adults (Male: 12; Female: 4) over a period of 30–45 days (approximately 1.5 months), yielding a relatively small volume of 539 records. To address this limitation, we employ various synthetic data generation methods, such as Gaussian Capula (GC), Conditional Tabular General Adversarial Network (CTGAN), and Tabular General Adversarial Network (TABGAN), to augment the dataset with synthetic data. For both the authentic and synthetic datasets, we have developed a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classification model for accurately classifying daily physical activity levels. The findings underscore the effectiveness of semantic ontology in semantic search, knowledge representation, data integration, reasoning, and capturing meaningful relationships between data. The analysis supports the hypothesis that the efficiency of predictive models improves as the volume of additional synthetic training data increases. Ontology and Generative AI hold the potential to expedite advancements in behavioral monitoring research. The data presented, encompassing both real MOX2-5 and its synthetic counterpart, serves as a valuable resource for developing robust methods in activity type classification. Furthermore, it opens avenues for exploration into research directions related to synthetic data, including model efficiency, detection of generated data, and considerations regarding data privacy. © The Author(s) 2024.",-,10.1038/s41598-024-55183-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185940438&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-024-55183-6&partnerID=40&md5=34b14a3671893a2c7ef5a15847a69310
Correlation between white blood cell count and intestinal resection in patients with acute mesenteric vein thrombosis,"Objective: Acute mesenteric vein thrombosis (AMVT) is an acute abdominal disease with onset, rapid progression, and extensive intestinal necrosis that requires immediate surgical resection. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors for nosocomial intestinal resection in patients with AMVT. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 64 patients with AMVT diagnosed by CTA at the Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology from January 2013 to December 2021. We compared patients who underwent intestinal resection (42 patients) with those who did not undergo intestinal resection (22 patients). The area under the ROC curve was evaluated, and a forest map was drawn. Results: Among the 64 patients, 6 (9.38%) had a fever, 60 (93.75%) had abdominal pain, 9 (14.06%) had a history of diabetes, 8 (12.5%) had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and 25 (39.06%) had ascites suggested by B ultrasound or CT after admission. The mean age of all patients was 49.86 ± 16.25 years. The mean age of the patients in the enterectomy group was 47.71 ± 16.20 years. The mean age of the patients in the conservative treatment group (without enterectomy) was 53.95 ± 15.90 years. In the univariate analysis, there were statistically significant differences in leukocyte count (P = 0.003), neutrophil count (P = 0.001), AST (P = 0.048), total bilirubin (P = 0.047), fibrinogen (P = 0.022) and DD2 (P = 0.024) between the two groups. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that admission white blood cell count (OR = 1.153, 95% CI: 1.039–1.280, P = 0.007) was an independent risk factor for intestinal resection in patients with AMVT. The ROC curve showed that the white blood cell count (AUC = 0.759 95% CI: 0.620–0.897; P = 0.001; optimal threshold: 7.815; sensitivity: 0.881; specificity: 0.636) had good predictive value for emergency enterectomy for AMVT. Conclusions: Among patients with AMVT, patients with a higher white blood cell count at admission were more likely to have intestinal necrosis and require emergency enterectomy. This study is helpful for clinicians to accurately determine whether emergency intestinal resection is needed in patients with AMVT after admission, prevent further intestinal necrosis, and improve the prognosis of patients. © The Author(s) 2024.",-,10.1186/s12876-024-03172-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185931063&doi=10.1186%2fs12876-024-03172-4&partnerID=40&md5=16e7e82550c7a33b2822a99c748bd210
Meta-analysis of clinical efficacy of thoracoscopy and robotic surgery in the treatment of mediastinal tumors,"Objective: Comparing the clinical efficacy of thoracoscopy and robotic surgery in the treatment of mediastinal tumors using meta-analysis. Methods: Computer retrieval of PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for literature comparing the clinical effects of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and robot-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) in treating mediastinal tumors, with the retrieval time limit from the establishment of the database to September 2023. Two evaluators independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4. Results: A total of 19 articles were included, with a total of 3517 patients. The results of the Meta-analysis showed that the RATS group had less intraoperative bleeding [MD = − 5.20, 95%CI (− 9.28, − 1.12), P = 0.01], lower rate of conversion to thoracotomy [OR = 0.41, 95%CI (0.23, 0.72), P = 0.002], lower rate of total postoperative complications [OR = 0.57, 95%CI (0.34, 0.95), P = 0.03], shorter postoperative drainage time [MD = − 0.72, 95%CI (− 1.13, − 0.32), P = 0.0004], and shorter postoperative hospital stay [MD = − 0.90, 95%CI (− 1.16, − 0.65), P < 0.001], in comparison with the VATS group. There was an insignificant difference between the two groups in terms of tumor size [MD = − 0.02, 95%CI (− 0.33, 0.30), P = 0.91] and operation time [MD = 0.17, 95%CI (− 7.61, 7.94), P = 0.97]. However, in regards to hospitalization costs [MD = 2634.75, 95%CI (991.62, 4277.88), P = 0.002], the RATS group was more expensive than the VATS group. Conclusion: Robot-assisted mediastinal tumor resection surgery has more advantages in terms of intraoperative bleeding, conversion to thoracotomy rate, total postoperative complication rate, postoperative drainage time, and postoperative hospital stay, in comparison with thoracoscopic-assisted mediastinal tumor resection surgery. There is an insignificant difference in tumor size and operation time between the two surgeries. However, robot-assisted mediastinal tumor resection surgery increases hospitalization costs. © The Author(s) 2024.",-,10.1186/s12957-024-03325-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186213519&doi=10.1186%2fs12957-024-03325-5&partnerID=40&md5=10919fb9594ff95bc9deb712d0c655b2
Exploring Superpower Design Through Wi-Fi Twinge,"Technology-facilitated “superpowers” are a popular topic in human-computer interaction, providing people with the experience of having superhero-like fantastic abilities. However, science fiction literature tells us that superpowers can also be unfortunate. We designed Wi-Fi Twinge, a system that uses electrical muscle stimulation to extend human perception to sense unseen Wi-Fi signals, giving people an allergy-like twinge reaction to Wi-Fi: a superpower that can be seen as unfortunate while also having potential benefits. Through an in-the-wild study, interviews with 12 participants revealed that although the superpower from Wi-Fi Twinge induced negative feelings and impacted certain day-to-day activities, it improved awareness of self and the surrounding environment. We used these results to offer design tactics for creating future superpower systems that consider potential unfortunate side effects. Ultimately, we aim to advance our understanding of technology-facilitated superpowers.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Implementing Computational Thinking Skills in Socio Scientific Issue (SSI) of Force Material Around Us at Elementary School,"Computational thinking is a sophisticated problem-solving approach based on computer science. Implementing computational thinking in elementary schools remains a challenge for education, particularly for teachers and students. Teachers must construct learning experiences using computational thinking to make the learning process more engaging, while students must solve issues logically, systematically, and effectively. This study aims to present an overview of the application of computational thinking in natural and social sciences (IPAS) learning and identify its application in fifth-grade elementary school students. The research employed a qualitative research design with a single one-shot case study. The research subjects were 40 fifth-grade students and four teachers. This investigation was conducted during a single meeting that followed the lesson plan for the force material around us. The findings revealed that (a) analysis of student activity data yielded a percentage of 81.25%; (b) the data analysis of student responses to learning yielded favorable results, approaching 100%. According to interviews and observations of CT (Computational Thinking) in SSI (Socio-scientific Issue) in IPAS subjects, implementing CT learning on the forces around us might bring up aspects of the CT foundation, such as pattern recognition decomposition, abstraction, and algorithms. The learning scenario is that students are requested to assess many types of activities that occur in everyday life. Additionally, students will outline various actions that use force. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

More Than Meets the AI: Evaluating the performance of GPT-4 on Computer Graphics assessment questions,"Recent studies have showcased the exceptional performance of LLMs (Large Language Models) on assessment questions across various discipline areas. This can be helpful if used to support the learning process, for example by enabling students to quickly generate and contrast alternative solution approaches. However, concerns about student over-reliance and inappropriate use of LLMs in education are common. Understanding the capabilities of LLMs is essential for instructors to make informed decisions on question choices for learning and assessment tasks. In CS (Computer Science), previous evaluations of LLMs have focused on CS1 and CS2 questions, and little is known about how well LLMs perform for assessment questions in upper-level CS courses such as CG (Computer Graphics), which covers a wide variety of concepts and question types. To address this gap, we compiled a dataset of past assessment questions used in a final-year undergraduate course about introductory CG, and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 on this dataset. We also classified assessment questions and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 for different types of questions. We found that the performance tended to be best for simple mathematical questions, and worst for questions requiring creative thinking, and those with complex descriptions and/or images. We share our benchmark dataset with the community and provide new insights into the capabilities of GPT-4 in the context of CG courses. We highlight opportunities for teaching staff to improve student learning by guiding the use of LLMs for CG questions, and inform decisions around question choices for assessment tasks. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A General Constructive Form of Higman’s Lemma,"In logic and computer science one often needs to constructivize a theorem ∀f∃g.P(f, g), stating that for every infinite sequence f there is an infinite sequence g such that P(f, g). Here P is a computable predicate but g is not necessarily computable from f. In this paper we propose the following constructive version of ∀f∃g.P(f, g): for every f there is a “long enough” finite prefix g0 of g such that P(f, g0), where “long enough” is expressed by membership to a bar which is a free parameter of the constructive version. Our approach with bars generalises the approaches to Higman’s lemma undertaken by Coquand–Fridlender, Murthy–Russell and Schwichtenberg–Seisenberger–Wiesnet. As a first test for our bar technique, we sketch a constructive theory of well-quasi orders. This includes yet another constructive version of Higman’s lemma: that every infinite sequence of words has an infinite ascending subsequence. As compared with the previous constructive versions of Higman’s lemma, our constructive proofs are closer to the original classical proofs. © Stefano Berardi, Gabriele Buriola, and Peter Schuster.",-,10.4230/LIPIcs.CSL.2024.16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185218561&doi=10.4230%2fLIPIcs.CSL.2024.16&partnerID=40&md5=d60ae6a3e6fa12ea2293e6e0e272a1a5
Fundamentals of Text-To-Image Synthesis - A Survey,"Text-to-Image Synthesis is the method of creating occurrences (images, animation) from a given text depiction. The text depiction is additionally combined, utilizing the discourse of the client. Image synthesizing has consistently been an eye-catching business sector for nearly ten years now. Blending pictures dependent on the depiction given by the client will be more client-driven than more frameworks created, which causes individuals to comprehend the impression of others. Text-to-picture Synthesis is utilized to create fake countenances - producing counterfeit faces that look practically indistinguishable from genuine individuals - Coloring pictures, MRI image reconstruction, and crime scene visualization. In this paper, we review the technique for text-to-picture Synthesis and its applications in different fields. These regions incorporate medical applications, Forensics applications, and cultural applications. Our work centers around giving a synopsis on quite possibly the most exceptionally encouraging areas of Computer Science for people and organizations keen on making an ideal world. We envision our review to acquire more significant and better applications contributing to the advancement of humankind. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

A Report on the Sixth Workshop on Emerging Software Engineering Education (WESEE 2024),"Software engineering is rapidly adapting to meet the demands of contemporary customers and the challenges posed by relentless technological advancements. A well-prepared and highly competent workforce is crucial to propel this evolution, making it a pivotal element for the successful future of software engineering. To instill the art and science of software engineering across diverse age groups, innovative teaching methods must be introduced at all levels of education dissemination. Software engineering stands out as one of the most dynamic subjects in computer science curricula, spanning both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, given the continuous emergence of new software development process models, methods, and tools. A comprehensive software engineering course should encompass various processes, methods, and tools necessary to support large-scale software systems’ development, operation, and maintenance. Moreover, these courses should significantly emphasize developing the interpersonal and communication skills essential for a well-rounded software engineer. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

"""It's not like Jarvis, but it's pretty close!"" - Examining ChatGPT's Usage among Undergraduate Students in Computer Science","Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Bard have garnered significant attention in the academic community. Previous research has evaluated these LLMs for various applications such as generating programming exercises and solutions. However, these evaluations have predominantly been conducted by instructors and researchers, not considering the actual usage of LLMs by students. This study adopts a student-first approach to comprehensively understand how undergraduate computer science students utilize ChatGPT, a popular LLM, released by OpenAI. We employ a combination of student surveys and interviews to obtain valuable insights into the benefits, challenges, and suggested improvements related to ChatGPT. Our findings suggest that a majority of students (over 57%) have a convincingly positive outlook towards adopting ChatGPT as an aid in coursework-related tasks. However, our research also highlights various challenges that must be resolved for long-term acceptance of ChatGPT amongst students. The findings from this investigation have broader implications and may be applicable to other LLMs and their role in computing education. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Patterns of Student Help-Seeking When Using a Large Language Model-Powered Programming Assistant,"Providing personalized assistance at scale is a long-standing challenge for computing educators, but a new generation of tools powered by large language models (LLMs) offers immense promise. Such tools can, in theory, provide on-demand help in large class settings and be configured with appropriate guardrails to prevent misuse and mitigate common concerns around learner over-reliance. However, the deployment of LLM-powered tools in authentic classroom settings is still rare, and very little is currently known about how students will use them in practice and what type of help they will seek. To address this, we examine students' use of an innovative LLM-powered tool that provides on-demand programming assistance without revealing solutions directly. We deployed the tool for 12 weeks in an introductory computer and data science course (n = 52), collecting more than 2,500 queries submitted by students throughout the term. We manually categorized all student queries based on the type of assistance sought, and we automatically analyzed several additional query characteristics. We found that most queries requested immediate help with programming assignments, whereas fewer requests asked for help on related concepts or for deepening conceptual understanding. Furthermore, students often provided minimal information to the tool, suggesting this is an area in which targeted instruction would be beneficial. We also found that students who achieved more success in the course tended to have used the tool more frequently overall. Lessons from this research can be leveraged by programming educators and institutions who plan to augment their teaching with emerging LLM-powered tools. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",49-57,10.1145/3636243.3636249,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182946916&doi=10.1145%2f3636243.3636249&partnerID=40&md5=b614225ed846234f755f3f55d80eaf87
NuzzleBug: Debugging Block-Based Programs in Scratch,"While professional integrated programming environments support developers with advanced debugging functionality, block-based programming environments for young learners often provide no support for debugging at all, thus inhibiting debugging and preventing debugging education. In this paper we introduce NuzzleBug, an extension of the popular block-based programming environment Scratch that provides the missing debugging support. NuzzleBug allows controlling the executions of Scratch programs with classical debugging functionality such as stepping and breakpoints, and it is an omniscient debugger that also allows reverse stepping. To support learners in deriving hypotheses that guide debugging, NuzzleBug is an interrogative debugger that enables to ask questions about executions and provides answers explaining the behavior in question. In order to evaluate NuzzleBug, we survey the opinions of teachers, and study the effects on learners in terms of debugging effectiveness and efficiency. We find that teachers consider NuzzleBug to be useful, and children can use it to debug faulty programs effectively. However, systematic debugging requires dedicated training, and even when NuzzleBug can provide correct answers learners may require further help to comprehend faults and necessary fixes, thus calling for further research on improving debugging techniques and the information they provide. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.
